<!-- ðŸ”¹ What is a Route in Web Development?

A route is basically a path (URL) + HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) that your server listens to and responds with something (like HTML, JSON, or text).

Think of it like directions on a map â€”
If you go to /home, you see the home page.
If you go to /about, you see the about page.
In Express.js, routes decide what happens when a user visits a certain URL. -->

What is a Route?

In Express.js, a route defines a path (URL) and the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that your server should respond to.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

app.get("/home", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Welcome to Home Page");
});

Here:

/home â†’ is the route (path)
get â†’ is the HTTP method
Inside, you define what to do when someone visits http://localhost:3000/home

2. Why Routes?

Routes let you organize different pages or functionalities in your app:

/login â†’ login page
/register â†’ signup page
/profile â†’ user profile page
So, the backend knows which function to run for each URL.

3. Types of Routes in Express

Basic Route:

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});


Route with Parameters:

app.get("/user/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID is ${req.params.id}`);
});


Route with Query:

app.get("/search", (req, res) => {
  res.send(`You searched for ${req.query.q}`);
});


âœ… In short:
A route = Path (URL) + HTTP method + Handler function. -->
