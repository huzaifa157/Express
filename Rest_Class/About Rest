# REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
# Itâ€™s a style (set of rules) for designing APIs.

# ðŸ”¹ In Simple Words

# REST is about how a client (like browser or mobile app) talks to a server using HTTP (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

# ðŸ”¹ REST Principles

# Use HTTP methods for actions

# GET â†’ Read data
# POST â†’ Create data
# PUT â†’ Update data
# DELETE â†’ Delete data

# Use URLs (endpoints) for resources
# Example:

# /users â†’ list of users
# /users/1 â†’ user with id 1

# Stateless

# Server does not remember previous requests.
# Each request must contain all needed info (like auth, data).
# Send/receive data in a standard format
# Usually JSON is used.

# ðŸ”¹ Example of REST API

# Imagine we have a users resource.

# GET /users â†’ Get all users
# GET /users/1 â†’ Get user with id = 1
# POST /users â†’ Add a new user
# PUT /users/1 â†’ Update user with id = 1
# DELETE /users/1 â†’ Delete user with id = 1

# âœ… In short:
# REST is just a way to design APIs where we use HTTP methods 
# (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on URLs (resources) and exchange data usually in JSON.

# âœ… In short:

# REST â†’ the concept.
# RESTful API â†’ an API designed using REST rules (clean URLs, proper HTTP methods, JSON).
