<!-- What is localhost?

localhost is just a special hostname that points to your own computer.
It always refers to the IP address 127.0.0.1 (loopback address). -->

<!-- So when you open:
http://localhost:3000

👉 Your browser is actually talking to a server running on your own PC, not the internet. -->
<!-- 
How it works

You run a server on your machine (for example Express.js on port 3000).
app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running"));

When you type http://localhost:3000 in your browser:

Browser asks: “Where is localhost?”
Your system translates it into 127.0.0.1 (your own PC).
The request is sent back to your own computer.
Your running server (Node/Express) on port 3000 receives that request and sends back a response. -->

<!-- ✅ In short -->

<!-- localhost = your own computer (IP 127.0.0.1).
Used for testing servers locally before deploying to the internet.
localhost:3000 → means port 3000 on your own computer. -->


<!-- local host vs ip address -->
<!-- 
               127.0.0.1

This is an IP address.
Known as the loopback address → it always points to your own machine.
Part of a special reserved range (127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255).

So when you type:
http://127.0.0.1:3000 : Your request never leaves your computer — it loops back to yourself.

🔹 localhost

This is a hostname (domain name).
It’s mapped to 127.0.0.1 by default (via your system’s hosts file).
Example: on Windows, check C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts, you’ll see a line like:  127.0.0.1   localhost

This means whenever you type localhost, your computer translates it to 127.0.0.1.

🔹 Key Difference

127.0.0.1 → IP address.
localhost → hostname that usually resolves to 127.0.0.1.

🔹 Fun fact
Sometimes localhost can also resolve to IPv6 (::1) depending on your system settings, but 127.0.0.1 is always IPv4.

✅ In short:

Both point to your own computer.
localhost is a name → usually mapped to → 127.0.0.1 (the loopback IP).
So typing http://localhost:3000 and http://127.0.0.1:3000 normally gives the same result. -->
