<!-- What is localhost?

localhost is just a special hostname that points to your own computer.
It always refers to the IP address 127.0.0.1 (loopback address). -->

<!-- So when you open:
http://localhost:3000

👉 Your browser is actually talking to a server running on your own PC, not the internet. -->
<!-- 
How it works

You run a server on your machine (for example Express.js on port 3000).
app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running"));

When you type http://localhost:3000 in your browser:

Browser asks: “Where is localhost?”
Your system translates it into 127.0.0.1 (your own PC).
The request is sent back to your own computer.
Your running server (Node/Express) on port 3000 receives that request and sends back a response. -->

<!-- ✅ In short -->

<!-- localhost = your own computer (IP 127.0.0.1).
Used for testing servers locally before deploying to the internet.
localhost:3000 → means port 3000 on your own computer. -->
